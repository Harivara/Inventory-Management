# Description

The project is built with Node.js and Express.js for the backend. Data is currently stored in-memory, using an array, instead of a real database. For testing, I used Jest to validate all the controller functions and ensure the API works as expected.
The goal of this project is to provide a simple way to manage products, update stock, and keep track of low-stock items.
